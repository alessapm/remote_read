## Obstacles 

Creating subcomments and getting them to display only for their corresponding comment. 

Getting my DOM Manipulation to work only on the div inside the specific comment that corresponds to the button. 

## Unsolved Problems 

Getting my ratings select to pre-populate in the Edit page. 

## Future Goals

I would like to have the Ratings in a post be re-calculated every time a comment is added, to be the average of the Ratings in all of its comments. 

I would like to be able to edit comments and subcomments. 

I would like to make my show page responsive.
